# Visualizing Georgaphic Information System Data with Leaflet

Alt-About the Data:
------------------
The United States Geological Survey provides public access to geological data that is consistently updated as data is input into their geogrtaphic information system. The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change.


The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools to visualize their [earthquake data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). This repository contains code used to map constantly changing data using leaflet. 


Alt-About the Code:
------------------
The "Leaflet-Part-1" folder contains HTML and JavaScript code used to create the earthquake visualization.

The "Leaflet-Part-2" folder contains code to plot additional (supplemental) data for the visualization; the additional data includes relevant seismic and techtonic plate data.
